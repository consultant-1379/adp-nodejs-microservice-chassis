# This file contains all of the 3PPs, 2PPs, which are not scanned by FOSSA correctly,
# or we have to create a hack because of the inconsistency between the FOSSA and BAZAAR and MUNIN.

# All of these entries should be checked manually periodically, because FOSSA scan is ignored to all of them.
# So delete or modify them in case the Chassis has another version from them, or the dependency is deleted.
